                Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at
                least 30,000 years, and thousands of engravings remain
                throughout the region, making it one of the richest in Australia
                in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites. During his first
                Pacific voyage in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook and his crew
                became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of
                Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British
                interest in the area. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led
                by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the
                first European settlement in Australia. Phillip named the
                settlement after Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney.Penal
                transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was
                incorporated as a city in 1842. A gold rush occurred in the
                colony in 1851, and over the next century, Sydney transformed
                from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and
                economic centre. After World War II, it experienced mass
                migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the
                world.At the time of the 2011 census, more than 250 different
                languages were spoken in Sydney.[14] In the 2016 Census, about
                35.8% of residents spoke a language other than English at
                home.Furthermore, 45.4% of the population reported having been
                born overseas, and the city has the third-largest foreign-born
                population of any city in the world after London and New York
                City.

                Melbourne is home to many of Australia's best-known landmarks,
                such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of
                Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition
                Building. It is also the birthplace of Australian impressionism,
                Australian rules football, and the Australian film and
                television industries. More recently, it has been recognised as
                a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art,
                live music and theatre. It hosts major annual international
                events such as the Australian Grand Prix, the Australian Open
                and the Melbourne Cup, and also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics
                and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Due to it rating highly in
                entertainment, tourism and sport, as well as education, health
                care, research and development, Melbourne consistently ranked as
                the world's most liveable city for much of the 2010s.

                One of the oldest cities in Australia, Brisbane was founded upon
                the ancient homelands of the indigenous Turrbal and Jagera
                peoples. Named after the Brisbane River on which it is
                located—which in turn takes its name from Sir Thomas Brisbane,
                the Governor of New South Wales at the time of the city's
                founding[10]—the area was chosen as a place for secondary
                offenders from the Sydney Colony. The Moreton Bay penal
                settlement was founded in 1824 at Redcliffe, 28 kilometres (17
                mi) north of the central business district, but was soon
                abandoned and moved to North Quay in 1825, opening to free
                settlement in 1842. Brisbane was chosen as the capital when
                Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales
                in 1859. During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in
                the Allied campaign and served as the South West Pacific
                headquarters for United States Army General Douglas MacArthur.

                Perth is divided into 30 local government areas and 250 suburbs,
                stretching from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the
                south, and east inland to The Lakes. Outside of the main CBD,
                important urban centres within Perth include Armadale,
                Fremantle, Joondalup, Midland and Rockingham. Most of those were
                originally established as separate settlements and retained a
                distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider
                metropolitan area. Mandurah, Western Australia's second-largest
                city, has in recent years formed a conurbation with Perth along
                the coast, though for most purposes it is still considered a
                separate city.
